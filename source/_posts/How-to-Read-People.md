People do things for reasons.
Maybe they just want to show off.
Maybe they have some wired view of value.
Maybe they want to gain something.
To read a person is to understand the reason behind the behaviours.
The reason can go very deep.
Maybe the trauma from childhood.
Maybe some hidden thought in the mind.
